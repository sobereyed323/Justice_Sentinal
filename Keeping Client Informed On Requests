Keeping a client informed and involved in the process through email is an excellent approach to maintaining transparency and ensuring that they are comfortable with the progress of their case. Here is a suggested email communication workflow to keep the client informed and to seek their approvals for appeals or any other necessary actions:

**1. Initial Email Confirmation:**
After the initial meeting and the agreement to proceed with the case, send an email to the client confirming the details discussed, the action plan, and what you will be working on next.

**2. Regular Updates:**
Establish a regular update schedule (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to inform the client of any progress or developments. Even if there has been no progress, it is important to communicate this to the client to manage their expectations.

**3. Request for Information or Action:**
Whenever additional information is required from the client, or an action needs to be taken, send a clear and concise email detailing what is needed, why it is needed, and any associated deadlines.

**4. Draft Review:**
Before submitting any official documents, such as FOIA requests or appeals, draft these documents and email them to the client for review. Ask for their feedback and approval before proceeding. 

**5. Response Notifications:**
Inform the client of any responses received from agencies, courts, or opposing parties. If a response necessitates a decision or an action, explain the situation and the options available. 

**6. Appeals and Next Steps:**
In case of a denial or an unfavorable outcome, communicate the reasons to the client and discuss potential options for an appeal or other recourse. Provide your recommendation and seek the client's approval via email before proceeding.

**7. Closing Loop:**
Whenever a stage of the process is completed, send an email summarizing the work done, the outcomes achieved, and what the next steps are.

**8. Prompt Responses:**
Encourage the client to respond promptly to any requests for information or decisions and offer support if they have questions or require clarification.

**9. Secure Communication:**
Keep in mind the sensitivity of the information being handled and ensure that email communications are secure. Use encrypted email services if necessary, especially when handling confidential information.

**10. Record Keeping:**
Maintain a record of all communications with the client for reference and in case any disputes arise about what was communicated or agreed upon.

This process ensures that the client is an active participant in their case and has the opportunity to make informed decisions at every stage. It is also a good practice for maintaining a strong attorney-client relationship and building trust. Remember to always respect client confidentiality and privacy in all communications.
