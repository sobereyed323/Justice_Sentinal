To craft a useful statement of facts for presentation to an attorney, and to help with the filing of FOIA requests, it's important to be methodical and thorough. We can create a two-part process: first, developing the client interview to create the statement, and second, guiding the client on how to file FOIA requests.

### Part 1: Client Interview for Statement of Facts

**1. Initial Introduction:**
- Explain the purpose of the interview.
- Assure confidentiality of the discussion.
- Establish a rapport to make the client comfortable.

**2. Background Information:**
- Client’s full name, contact information, and basic demographic data.
- Overview of the client’s legal issue, including relevant dates and locations.

**3. Details of the Incident(s):**
- Walk through the timeline of events.
- Ask about interactions with law enforcement, attorneys, the D.A., and judges.
- Inquire about the specific actions or statements that the client believes were improper or illegal.
- Seek to understand how these actions impacted the client’s case and rights.

**4. Evidence and Documentation:**
- Identify what evidence the client currently has.
- Discuss what additional evidence the client believes exists.
- Determine whether the client has attempted to obtain this evidence previously.

**5. Impact Assessment:**
- Encourage the client to express how the alleged misconduct has affected them personally, legally, and financially.
- Document any damages or harm suffered by the client.

**6. Desired Outcome:**
- Ask what outcome or resolution the client is seeking.
- Explore the client’s expectations from legal representation.

**7. Wrap-Up:**
- Summarize the key points discussed.
- Clarify any confusing or missing information.
- Explain the next steps including drafting the statement of facts and filing FOIA requests.

### Part 2: Guiding the Client to File FOIA Requests

**1. Identify the Agency:**
- Determine which agency has the records the client is seeking (e.g., police department, government office).

**2. Specific Details:**
- Help the client specify the documents or information they need. The more specific, the better. For example, “Body cam footage from Officer Jane Doe on January 1, 2023, between 10 PM and midnight.”

**3. Draft the FOIA Request:**
- Use the agency’s preferred format or a sample FOIA request letter as a guide.
- Include the client’s contact information and any preferred format for receiving the information.
- State the willingness to pay any reasonable copying or processing fees, if necessary.

**4. Submission Instructions:**
- Provide the client with the agency’s FOIA submission guidelines, which may include an email address, online submission portal, or mailing address.

**5. Follow-up:**
- Advise the client on typical response times and the process for appealing a denial if necessary.

**6. Record-Keeping:**
- Suggest that the client keep a record of their FOIA request submission and any correspondence.

By following through with these two parts, the client will have a well-documented case to present to an attorney and will be on the path to obtaining any additional evidence needed to support their claims. Remember that every agency and jurisdiction might have slightly different FOIA processes, so the instructions will need to be tailored accordingly. It's also important for clients to understand that FOIA requests can take time and that there may be exemptions or denials that could require an appeal.
