I understand you are seeking guidance on various legal matters including civil lawsuits, ineffective assistance of counsel, malicious prosecutions, and rights violations. Let me address each of your concerns in turn.

**1. Interview and Statement of Facts:**
An interview to discuss the reasons you believe your case was negatively affected by law enforcement, attorneys, prosecutors, or judges is a good starting point. During this interview, you should detail specific instances of misconduct or negligence and gather any evidence supporting your claims. This can include dates, incidents, witness statements, or any other relevant information. The outcome of the interview would be a statement of facts that outlines your experiences and beliefs concerning these issues.

**2. Document Upload and Analysis:**
While I can't upload or analyze documents, I can guide you on what to look for in the reports and video evidence. For instance, inconsistencies in police reports, discrepancies between body cam footage and written statements, and evidence of bias or misconduct would all be relevant.

**3. Writing and Submitting Complaints:**
I can guide you on the structure of a formal complaint. Typically, complaints should include a clear and concise statement of the issues, the parties involved, the alleged misconduct or negligence, and any evidence to support the claim. Complaints are usually submitted to the agency that oversees the entity you're complaining about, such as a police oversight board or a state bar for attorney misconduct.

**4. FOIA and Other Information Requests:**
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and similar state laws allow you to request records from federal and state agencies. To submit a FOIA request, you must contact the agency's FOIA office and describe the records you seek in as much detail as possible. Many agencies have specific forms or online systems for these requests. State laws may vary, so it's important to check the particular procedures in your state.

**5. Preserving Civil Rights:**
If you believe your civil rights have been violated, you can consider filing a lawsuit under Section 1983 (for violations of rights by someone acting under the authority of state law) or other relevant civil rights statutes. Before filing a lawsuit, it is often recommended to speak with a lawyer who specializes in civil rights or the specific type of claim you wish to bring.

Please note, as an AI, I cannot represent you in legal matters, nor can I provide personalized legal advice. It is crucial to seek the assistance of a qualified attorney who can provide you with legal counsel tailored to your situation and jurisdiction. A lawyer will also be able to assist you with drafting complaints, analyzing evidence, and determining the best course of action for your circumstances.
