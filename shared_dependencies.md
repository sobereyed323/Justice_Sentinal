1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It includes links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and contains the DOM elements for AI Bot and 3D Robocop interaction.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that contains the custom styles for the website and any styling related to AI Bot and 3D Robocop's interaction UI.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It is imported into the "styles.css" file and its classes are used in the "index.html" file.

4. "ai_bot.js": This is the main JavaScript file for the AI Bot. It uses 'axios' for fetching data, 'OpenAI' for AI processing, and inbuilt functionalities for customers' intake and for filing information to agencies. It also interacts with 3D Robocop to provide a unique user experience.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") to apply styles to specific elements and also to identify AI Bot and 3D Robocop interface.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for the styles in the CSS files. They are used in the "index.html" file to apply the styles to the HTML elements.

3. CSS Import: The "styles.css" file imports the "tailwind.css" file. This allows the styles from Tailwind to be used in the "styles.css" file and subsequently in the "index.html" file.

4. HTML Link Tags: The "index.html" file uses link tags to include the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This allows the styles from these files to be applied to the HTML elements in the "index.html" file.

5. OpenAI API Key: The key used for connecting and interacting with the OpenAI service.

6. Axios: A library used for promises-based HTTP client for browser and node.js, used in ai_bot.js for sending HTTP requests.

7. JavaScript Classes: We have used JavaScript class 'AIBot' to encapsulate related methods that support the functionalities needed to fulfill the requirements of the AI Bot and 3D Robocop interface.
