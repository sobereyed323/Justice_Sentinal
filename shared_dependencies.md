1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will also contain the DOM elements for AI Bot interaction.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain the custom styles for the website and any styling related to AI Bot's interaction UI.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be imported into the "styles.css" file and its classes will be used in the "index.html" file.

4. "ai_bot.js": This is the main JavaScript file for the AI Bot. It uses 'axios' for fetching data, 'OpenAI' for AI processing, and inbuilt functionalities for customers' intake and for filing information to agencies.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for the HTML elements in the "index.html" file. They are used in the CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") to apply styles to the specific elements. Now also used for identifying the AI bot section.

2. CSS Class Names: These are the identifiers for the styles in the CSS files. They are used in the "index.html" file to apply the styles to the HTML elements.

3. CSS Import: The "styles.css" file will import the "tailwind.css" file. This allows the styles from Tailwind to be used in the "styles.css" file and subsequently in the "index.html" file.

4. HTML Link Tags: The "index.html" file will use link tags to include the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. This allows the styles from these files to be applied to the HTML elements in the "index.html" file.

5. OpenAI API Key: The key used for connecting and interacting with the OpenAI service.

6. Axios: A library used for promises-based HTTP client for browser and node.js, we use it in ai_bot.js for sending HTTP requests.

7. JavaScript Classes: We have used JavaScript class 'AIBot' to encapsulate related methods that support the functionalities needed to fulfill the requirements of the AI Bot.
