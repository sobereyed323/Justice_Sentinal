# Justice Sentinel Code Quality Guide

This document serves as a guide to outline the code quality and standards followed in the Justice Sentinel project. The guidelines presented herein are aimed at maintaining a high code quality and ensuring readability and maintainability of code for any future improvements.

## Code Review

- Always conduct a code review before finalizing changes. Peer feedback is essential to catch bugs and bad practices early.

## Testing

- Our codebase maintains an automated test suit. Every change is expected to pass all tests before it's pushed to production.

## Consistent Code Style

- Consistently format code. Naming variables, line lengths, file organization, spaces and indentation are all places we maintain consistency.

## Comments

- Good comments don't duplicate the code. Instead they explain why the code does something, not what it does.

## Documentation

- Document code and write instruction on how to run the program from install to startup.

Remember, the way we write code should allow others to intuitively understand, effortlessly navigate, and safely modify code. Always keep code quality in mind.
